Automate The Boring Stuff
=====

Course notes for the "Automate The Boring Stuff course, summer 2019 edition. The main language we'll use is _Python_, but the knowledge gained from this course can be applied to any language. It is not an academic course, but meant to eliminate the boring/repetitive tasks from your daily (work/digital) life.

The content on this repository will only be truly useful to you if you actually follow the interactive course lectures. Recordings of each lecture will be provided, but live attendance of the course is recommended.

If you cannot attend the course in Lochristi, Belgium, you can still join using the Zoom link provided in the Telegram Group.

[JumpScaleX](https://github.com/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX), an automation framework written in Python, will also be covered as part of this course and how it can help you automate the boring stuff.
