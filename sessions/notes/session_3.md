Sheets that we developed together in Google Sheets as a reference:

Sheets:

- link to the merged python data in sheets (with source data): <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tPcqOkRm8wUqWKPL3dn-XrRmi7niT_qnoztsNoIMBNQ/edit?usp=sharing>
- link to the same merging automation task but using sheets query capabilities: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hCGJDIgyVBAyUZVh7fOrxmdlMKq8KoqD3Fbfb9zflWw/edit?usp=sharing> (also includes the winner data sheet as an extra)

References:

- <https://support.google.com/docs#topic=1382883> is where you can look up any google sheet function (also usueful to just guess how a function might be called so you can see if you can find a function that might help you with your task)
- <https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/querylanguage> is the reference documentation for the Query language used by google (and developed by them) that you can use with the Query function of Google Sheets (very similar to SQL and such, should you have ever used that)

Python Script that we developed together:
- <https://github.com/GlenDC/atbs-2019-summer/blob/master/sessions/scripts/session_3_merge_data.py> (a small update from last session, allowing us to import the merged data back into sheets)
